It is generally believe that internet play an active role in our lives.
however, in my opinion, internet is huge valuable invention of human to change life style.
online services has been created by internet,In the sense that we can easily access to huge source of 
information.Finally, fast and easy accessble to the information creates the online stores and
other online services.

To begin with, One of the reasons for the success of the widespread use of the Internet is the 
creation of a large global network, so that by creating an integrated infrastructure, all users
have the ability to connect at the appropriate speed.Certainly, with the creation of a global 
infrastructure and free access, different and diverse facilities were created in the context of
this global network. For instance , our access to a virtual library anywhere in the world or
online store shows the speed and quality of sending and receiving information.How it makes 
global access pervasive and easy to access, and the use of a variety of tools in this context 
creates creative services such as Internet taxis and the use of Internet maps and satellite 
locations, as well as Virtual museums and schools have spread various technologies along with 
the Internet due to the existence of this efficient infrastructure in order to create services
and applications suitable for life is easier.

Furthermore,In addition, it can be said that the use of the Internet is so widespread that it
has penetrated into all layers of our lives and can not be said to only create and enable
services. It had false news and rumors and policies that could be spread in the society,
but today, despite the extensive social networks that have the ability to provide information
with high access and speed, false news and rumors do not have a long life. It will be very 
different on different events in every corner of the world.Finally, it can be said that the
Internet is not a service but a society in which speed and easy access have made it 
possible to focus a large part of the events of the world community.

In conclusion,I believe that the Internet has certainly had a profound effect on human life and 
has brought about far-reaching changes in improving life, and that this will certainly become an 
integral part of our human lives with various inventions and the use of the Internet.
