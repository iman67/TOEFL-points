Introduction

The first part of your TOEFL independent essay must always be the introductory paragraph.  Follow this template:

Sentence One: The “Hook”
This is an interesting sentence that introduces the general theme or topic of the essay.  I recommend stating something that we should do in our life:  “It is critically important that we VERB…“
Sentence Two: The Main Point
This is your main argument and direct answer to the question. Start with “Personally, I believe…“
Sentence Three: The Transition
Just use: “I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.”


It is critically important that students learn as much as possible and thrive in all of their classes. Personally, I believe that young people do not have as much respect for their teachers as in the past. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.

There are a few things to keep in mind as you write your introduction:

Don’t waste time on the opening hook.  It isn’t that important.
Don’t copy and paste from the prompt.
Write about 50 words.

a) General background statement on the topic

In the very first sentence of your Independent Writing, it is best to start the general background of the topic question. For example, if you are asked about your opinion on the use of cell phones by teenagers, your first sentence can be something general like: “Nowadays, cell phones play an increasingly important role in teenager’s lives.” This is not stating your opinion, but generally mentioning the background on this topic. Here are some other phrases you can use to start:

Nowadays,…
These days,…
In today’s society,…
At present,…
In this day and age,…
Currently,…
________________
It’s commonly accepted that…
It’s widely believed that…
It’s generally acknowledged that…
________________
The debate over….
People remain divided over…
There is no consensus on whether…
The issue of…
People tend to hold different views on…

Here are some phrases you can use to end your first sentence:

…has fundamentally changed our lives.
… plays an increasingly important role in…
…continues to advance at an astonishing rate.
…The progress in….has enabled us to…
__________________________________________________________
…is an increasingly disturbing issue.
… has drawn widespread attention.
…is having a profound impact on…
___________________________________________________________

Writing Body Paragraphs
Next you must write two body paragraphs that support your thesis. Use this template for your first body paragraph:

Sentence One: A Topic Sentence
This summarizes your first supporting reason. Begin with “To begin with…“.
Sentences Two and Three: The Explanation
Explain what you mean, without talking directly about a personal experience.
Sentence Four: The Transition
Just use: “My personal experience is a compelling illustration of this.“
Sentence Six to End: The Personal Example
An example from your life that illustrates this argument. It should make up about 60% of the body paragraph.


This leads to a paragraph like this:

To begin with, there are many more ways for students to learn nowadays, which means they are less reliant on teachers than in the past. A few years ago, children could only acquire new skills by going to school and attending classes, so they respected their teachers a lot. In contrast, now they can easily use technology to learn independently. My personal experience is a compelling illustration of this.  For the past five years, I have studied English almost every single day. Although my native language is Korean, I am able to easily communicate in English without feeling any anxiety.  I expand my vocabulary by using a smartphone application that teaches me new phrases twice per day, and I practice pronunciation by watching videos on the Internet.  Consequently, I feel like old-fashioned classes with a teacher are not as important as they used to be.  If I had tried to become proficient in English twenty years ago, I would have depended on a teacher and respected her a lot.
