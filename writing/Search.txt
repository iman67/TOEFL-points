Styles of Questions
There are four main styles of TOEFL independent essay questions in 2020.  They look like this:

Agree/Disagree Style (65% of the time)
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Children should be required to follow strict rules set by their parents.
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. Do not use memorized examples.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Students do not respect their teachers as much as they did in the past.
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 

Multiple Choice Style (15% of the time)
Which of the following values do you think is best to teach to a young child?

being honest
being helpful
being patient
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

Preference Style (15 % of the time)
There are many different styles of classes at schools nowadays.
Some students prefer classes where they interact with their teacher and with other students in debates and group assignments. 
Others prefer classes where they just listen to their teacher speak. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Make sure to use your own words. Do not use memorized examples.

Good Idea Style (very rare)
A company has decided to forbid its employees from working through email and telephone calls during the weekend.
They believe that this will make the employees happier and more satisfied. Do you think this is a good idea?

Note that the multiple choice and preference type questions are very long these days.  Don’t be surprised if you get a very wordy question!

The warning to “not use memorized examples” refers to ETS’s new efforts to crack down on plagiarism and memorized essays used by hundreds of students at the same time.
It is still okay to use templates and it is still okay to use personal examples.
